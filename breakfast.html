            1. Boil Water: Fill a saucepan with enough water to cover the eggs you plan to cook. Add a pinch of salt to the water if desired, as it can help prevent
            the eggs from cracking.

            2. Bring Water to a Boil: Place the saucepan on the stove over medium-high heat. Bring the water to a rolling boil.

            3. Add Eggs: Gently lower the eggs into the boiling water using a slotted spoon or tongs. Be careful not to crack the eggs when placing them into the 
            water.

            4. Cook for the Desired Time: For a classic half-boiled egg with a runny yolk and set egg white, cook the eggs for about 4-6 minutes, depending on your 
            preference. Adjust the cooking time slightly if you prefer a firmer or more runny yolk.

            5. Remove and Serve: Using the slotted spoon or tongs, carefully remove the eggs from the boiling water and place them in egg cups or small bowls.
            You can 
            also serve them directly in their shells.

            6. To eat, tap the top of the eggshell with a knife or egg topper to create a small opening. Remove the top part of the eggshell, and you'll have a perfect 
            half-boiled egg.

            7. Serve the eggs with buttered toast for dipping and enjoy!</pre>
