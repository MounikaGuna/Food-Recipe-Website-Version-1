                            <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
                            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
                            <li>2 tablespoons butter </li>

            <h1>Preparation</h1>
            <div class="recipe"><pre>
            1. Preheat your oven to 425째F (220째C).

            2. Line a pie dish with one of the pie crusts, pressing it gently against the bottom and sides of the dish.
                
            3. In a large mixing bowl, combine the sliced apples, granulated sugar, and ground cinnamon. Toss until the apples are coated evenly with the sugar 
            and cinnamon.
                
            4. Pour the apple mixture into the pie crust-lined dish. Dot the top of the apples with small pieces of butter.
                
            5. Place the second pie crust over the apples. Trim any excess crust and crimp the edges to seal the pie. You can also create a decorative pattern on 
            the top crust with a sharp knife or use a pie crust cutter to make designs.
                
            6. Cut a few slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape while baking.
                
            7. Place the pie on a baking sheet (to catch any drips) and bake in the preheated oven for about 45-55 minutes or until the crust is golden brown, and 
            the filling is bubbling.
                
            8. Remove the pie from the oven and let it cool for at least 30 minutes before serving. This allows the filling to set.
                
            9. Slice and serve your delicious homemade apple pie! You can enjoy it plain or with a scoop of vanilla ice cream for an extra treat.

            <div class="recipe"><pre>
            1. Bloom the Gelatin: If using gelatin sheets, soak them in cold water for about 5-10 minutes until they become soft. If using powdered gelatin, sprinkle 
            it over a couple of tablespoons of cold water and let it sit for a few minutes to bloom.

            2. Heat Cream and Sugar: In a saucepan, combine the heavy cream and sugar. Heat it over medium heat, stirring constantly, until it's hot but not boiling. 
            Remove it from the heat.
                
            3. Add Gelatin: If you're using gelatin sheets, squeeze out any excess water and add them to the hot cream mixture, stirring until the gelatin dissolves 
            completely. If using powdered gelatin, simply stir it into the hot cream until it dissolves.
                
            4. Add Vanilla: Stir in the vanilla extract for flavor.
                
            5. Pour and Set: Pour the mixture into individual serving glasses or molds. Allow them to cool to room temperature, then cover and refrigerate for at 
            least 4 hours, or until set.
                
            6. Serve: Once the panna cotta has set, you can garnish it with fresh berries or a fruit sauce of your choice before serving.

            <div class="recipe"><pre>
            1. Prepare the Dough: Mix khoya and milk powder in a bowl until they form a smooth, lump-free mixture. If needed, you can add a little milk to 
            make the dough pliable.

            2. Shape into Balls: Divide the dough into small portions and roll them into smooth, crack-free balls. Ensure there are no cracks, as they can 
            cause the Gulab Jamun to break while frying.
                
            3. Heat Oil or Ghee: Heat the ghee or oil in a deep pan on medium-low heat. To check if it's hot enough, drop a small piece of dough into the 
            oil; it should sizzle and rise to the surface.
                
            4. Fry the Gulab Jamun: Carefully add the prepared dough balls to the hot oil. Fry them on low heat, gently turning them to ensure even browning. 
            They should turn a deep golden brown color.
                
            5. Prepare Sugar Syrup: While the Gulab Jamun is frying, make the sugar syrup by dissolving sugar in water. Add a few drops of rose water and a 
            pinch of cardamom powder for flavor. Bring it to a gentle boil, then turn off the heat.
                
            6. Soak and Serve: Once the Gulab Jamun is golden brown, remove them from the oil and drain on a paper towel. Immediately transfer them to the 
            warm sugar syrup. Allow them to soak for at least a few hours or overnight for the best results. Serve warm or at room temperature
