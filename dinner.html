                1. Marinate the chicken: In a bowl, combine the yogurt, half of the minced garlic, half of the minced ginger, garam masala, chili powder, turmeric, 
                cumin, salt, and pepper. Add the chicken pieces and mix well to coat. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes (or longer for better flavor).

                2. Cook the chicken: Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet or pan over medium-high heat. Add the marinated chicken pieces and cook until they are
                are browned and cooked through, about 5-7 minutes. Remove the cooked chicken from the pan and set it aside.

                3. Prepare the sauce: In the same pan, add the chopped onion and sauté until it becomes translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the remaining minced garlic  
                and ginger and cook for another 1-2 minutes. Stir in the tomato sauce or crushed tomatoes and cook for about 5 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.

                4. Finish the dish: Return the cooked chicken to the pan and stir it into the sauce. Add the butter and heavy cream, stirring well until the sauce will
                become creamy and heated through. Simmer for an additional 5 minutes to let the flavors meld. Adjust salt, pepper, and chili powder to taste.

                5. Serve: Garnish with fresh cilantro leaves, if desired. Serve your homemade butter chicken hot, ideally with naan, rice, or roti. Enjoy!

            1. Marinate the Paneer: Mix yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric, garam masala, and salt to create a marinade. Coat the paneer 
            cubes with this mixture and let them marinate for at least 30 minutes.

            2. Grill or Roast the Paneer: You can grill the marinated paneer cubes in an oven or on a stovetop griddle until they are slightly charred and cooked  
            through. This gives them a smoky flavor.

            3. Prepare the Sauce: In a separate pan, heat oil or ghee. Add cumin seeds and sauté onions until they turn translucent. Add ginger, garlic, and
            spices (coriander, red chili powder, turmeric, garam masala) and cook until the spices release their aroma. Then, add chopped tomatoes and cook 
            until they soften.

            4. Blend and Simmer: Let the tomato mixture cool slightly, then blend it into a smooth paste. Return it to the pan, add cream, and simmer the sauce until
            it thickens and the oil starts to separate.

            5. Combine and Serve: Add the grilled paneer to the sauce, simmer for a few more minutes, and garnish with fresh coriander leaves. Your paneer tikka
            masala is ready to be served with naan, rice, or roti.

            <div class="recipe"><pre>
                
            1. Marinate: In a large bowl, mix yogurt, tandoori masala spice blend, garlic and ginger paste, and lemon juice to create a marinade. Adjust the 
            amount of spice blend to your desired level of heat.

            2. Score the Chicken: Use a sharp knife to make 2-3 deep cuts in each chicken piece. This helps the marinade penetrate and flavor the meat.

            3. Marinate the Chicken: Add the chicken pieces to the marinade, making sure they are well-coated. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least
            2 hours, or preferably overnight for better flavor.

            4. Preheat the Grill or Oven: If using a grill, preheat it to medium-high heat. If using an oven, preheat it to the highest broil setting.

            5. Cook the Chicken: Thread the marinated chicken pieces onto skewers (if grilling) or place them on a baking sheet (if using the oven). Grill 
            or broil the chicken for about 20-25 minutes, turning occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through and has a nice charred appearance.
