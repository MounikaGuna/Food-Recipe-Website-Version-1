                1. Preheat: Preheat your oven to the highest temperature it can go, typically around 500°F (260°C), and place a pizza stone or baking sheet  
                in the oven to heat up.

                2. Roll Out Dough: Roll out your pizza dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness, then transfer it to a piece of parchment paper.
                
                3. Add Sauce and Toppings: Spread the pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Add your choice of cheese 
                and toppings.
                
                4. Bake: Carefully transfer the parchment paper with the pizza onto the hot pizza stone or baking sheet in the oven. Bake for about 10-15 
                minutes or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.
                
                5. Serve: Remove the pizza from the oven, let it cool for a minute, then slice and enjoy your homemade pizza!1.

                 slightly toasted.

                4. Place the cooked sausages into the toasted buns and add your preferred condiments, such as mustard, ketchup, chopped onions, pickles, 
                or relish.

            meat mixture into a loaf or round shape.

            2. Cook the Meat: Grill or roast the meat until it's cooked through and has a crispy exterior. You can use a vertical rotisserie for the most
            traditional preparation.

            3. Make the Tzatziki Sauce: Grate cucumber and squeeze out excess moisture. Mix it with yogurt, minced garlic, lemon juice, fresh dill, salt,
            and pepper to create the tzatziki sauce.

            4. Assemble the Gyros: Warm the pita bread, then layer slices of the cooked gyro meat, sliced tomatoes, onions, and lettuce if desired. Drizzle
            a generous amount of tzatziki sauce over the top.

            5. Serve: Roll the pita around the fillings, securing it with parchment paper or foil if needed, and serve your homemade gyro immediately. Enjoy
            your delicious Greek-inspired gyro sandwich!

                    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
                        <ul>
                            <li>4 large russet potatoes, peeled and cut into long strips</li>
                            <li>2 cups vegetable oil, for frying</li>
                            <li>Salt, to taste</li>
                            <li>Optional seasonings: paprika, garlic powder</li>

            <h1>Preparation</h1>
            <div class="recipe"><pre>

            1. Preheat the Oil: In a large, deep skillet or a Dutch oven, heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat until it reaches 350-375°F (175-190°C).

            2. Prepare the Potatoes: While the oil is heating, rinse the potato strips in cold water to remove excess starch. Pat them dry with paper towels 
            to prevent splattering when frying.
                
            3. Fry the Potatoes: Carefully add a batch of potato strips to the hot oil, making sure not to overcrowd the pan. Fry for about 3-4 minutes or 
            until they turn golden brown and crispy. Use a slotted spoon to remove the fries and place them on a paper towel-lined plate. Repeat with the 
            remaining batches.
                
            4. Season the Fries: While the fries are still hot, sprinkle them with salt and any optional seasonings you prefer, such as paprika or garlic 
            powder. Toss them gently to distribute the seasoning evenly.
                
            5. Serve: Serve your homemade French fries immediately while they are hot and crispy. Enjoy with ketchup, mayonnaise, or your favorite dipping
            sauce.
