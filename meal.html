                            <li>Arborio rice - 1 cup</li>
                            <li>Mushrooms (sliced) - 8 ounces</li>
                            <li>Onion (finely chopped) - 1</li>
                            <li>Garlic (minced) - 2 cloves</li>
                            <li>Chicken or vegetable broth - 4 cups</li>

            <div class="recipe"><pre>
               
                1. Sauté the Mushrooms: In a large skillet or pan, heat some olive oil over medium heat. Add the sliced mushrooms and sauté them until they 
                become tender and browned, about 5-7 minutes.Remove the mushrooms from the pan and set them aside.

                2. Cook the Aromatics: In the same pan, add a bit more olive oil if needed, and then add the finely chopped onion and minced garlic. Sauté it
                them until the onion becomes translucent, which takes about 2-3 minutes.
                
                3. Toast the Rice: Add the Arborio rice to the pan with the onions and garlic. Stir the rice constantly for about 2 minutes until it becomes very
                slightly translucent at the edges.
                
                4. Add Broth Gradually: Begin adding the chicken or vegetable broth, one ladle at a time, to the rice mixture. Stir constantly and allow the 
                liquid to be absorbed before adding more broth. Continue this process until the rice is creamy and cooked al dente. It should take about 18
                to 20 minutes.
                
                5. Finish with Mushrooms: Once the rice is cooked, stir in the sautéed mushrooms and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes to heat them through. 
                Season with salt and pepper to taste. You can also add grated Parmesan cheese and a knob of butter for extra creaminess if desired.</pre>

            <div class="recipe"><pre>
               
            1. Prepare the Sauce: In a bowl, mix together 1/2 cup soy sauce, 1/4 cup sugar, and any optional minced garlic and ginger. This is your teriyaki 
            sauce.

            2. Marinate the Chicken: Place the chicken pieces in a resealable plastic bag or a shallow dish. Pour half of the teriyaki sauce over the chicken,
            ensuring it's well-coated. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes, or ideally, a few hours.

            3. Cook the Chicken: Heat a pan or grill over medium-high heat. Remove the chicken from the marinade and cook it for about 5-7 minutes on each side
            or until it's cooked through and has a nice caramelized exterior. You can also bake it in the oven at 375°F (190°C) for about 25-30 minutes.

            4. Simmer the Sauce: In a saucepan, bring the remaining teriyaki sauce to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for a few minutes until it 
            thickens slightly. This will be used as a glaze.

            5. Glaze and Serve: Once the chicken is cooked, brush it with the simmered teriyaki glaze or drizzle it over the chicken. Garnish with sesame seeds 
            if desired. Serve your homemade teriyaki chicken with steamed rice and your favorite vegetables. Enjoy!</pre>
